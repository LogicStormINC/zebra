> This is the active executable task registry for Zebra Agent.
> Status, owner, branch, and evidence must be maintained by humans.
> Current execution range: Phase 2 from `实施任务拆解与阶段验收.md`.

## Global Rules

- Read `AGENTS.md`, `实施任务拆解与阶段验收.md`, `02_Codex-like工程Agent平台_多人协作任务分配与RACI_v1.0.md`, and `PROGRESS.md` before claiming a task.
- One task allows one primary goal, one human owner, one branch, one worktree, and one main PR.
- Paths outside `Owned paths` are out of scope unless the task definition is explicitly updated first.
- If a task needs real credentials, broad policy changes, or cross-boundary refactors, stop and escalate.
- Finish by running the task-specific validation plus `make check` when applicable.

## Status Legend

`Locked` / `Ready` / `In Progress` / `Review` / `Blocked` / `Done`

## Phase 2 Task Board

### P2-RT-01 - LocalRuntime Process Execution

- Status: `Done`
- Owner: `UNASSIGNED`
- Suggested role: `RUNTIME`
- Depends on: `Phase 1 completed`
- Branch: `codex/p2-rt-01-local-runtime`
- Owned paths: `packages/agent-runtime/`, `packages/agent-core/src/agent_core/ports/runtime.py`, `tests/`

#### Goal

Implement a real `LocalRuntime` that can execute a constrained command process through the existing `RuntimePort`.

#### Deliverables

- process execution API
- timeout handling
- exit code capture
- stdout and stderr capture contract
- tests for successful execution and timeout or failure behavior

#### Acceptance

- [x] Runtime can execute a simple command and return structured results.
- [x] Timeout behavior is deterministic and tested.
- [x] No `agent-core` module imports infrastructure SDKs because of this task.
- [x] Validation commands and results are recorded in the PR or work log.

### P2-RT-02 - Workspace And Worktree Abstractions

- Status: `Done`
- Owner: `UNASSIGNED`
- Suggested role: `RUNTIME`
- Depends on: `P2-RT-01`
- Branch: `codex/p2-rt-02-workspace-abstraction`
- Owned paths: `packages/agent-runtime/`, `tests/`

#### Goal

Add local workspace abstractions that prepare later file, patch, and git tools without yet implementing the full sandbox flow.

#### Deliverables

- workspace model
- repository path handling
- worktree abstraction or placeholder interface
- tests for path normalization and workspace lifecycle

#### Acceptance

- [x] Runtime-side workspace handling is typed and testable.
- [x] Path normalization and invalid path behavior are covered by tests.
- [x] The implementation stays within runtime boundaries.

### P2-TOOL-01 - Tool Contracts And Execution Results

- Status: `Review`
- Owner: `UNASSIGNED`
- Suggested role: `CTX`
- Depends on: `Phase 1 completed`
- Branch: `codex/p2-tool-01-tool-results`
- Owned paths: `packages/agent-tools/`, `packages/agent-core/src/agent_core/py.typed`, `tests/`

#### Goal

Create the first concrete execution-layer tool contracts and result structures behind the existing core tool gateway boundary.

#### Deliverables

- runtime-facing tool result model
- tool registry or execution scaffolding
- validation of tool identity and arguments shape
- tests for invalid or unknown tool calls

#### Acceptance

- [x] Tool execution paths reject invalid inputs before runtime execution.
- [x] Result model is structured enough for later command and file tools.
- [x] Tests cover success path and invalid input path.

### P2-TOOL-02 - Builtin File Read Path

- Status: `Done`
- Owner: `UNASSIGNED`
- Suggested role: `CTX`
- Depends on: `P2-TOOL-01`, `P2-RT-02`
- Branch: `codex/p2-tool-02-file-read`
- Owned paths: `packages/agent-tools/`, `packages/agent-runtime/`, `tests/`

#### Goal

Implement the first builtin file read path using runtime-side workspace constraints.

#### Deliverables

- read-file builtin tool
- path validation
- oversized output behavior
- tests for normal reads and path rejection

#### Acceptance

- [x] Reads outside the allowed workspace are rejected.
- [x] Normal read behavior is deterministic and tested.
- [x] Output behavior for large files is defined.

### P2-TOOL-03 - Builtin Command Execution Path

- Status: `Done`
- Owner: `UNASSIGNED`
- Suggested role: `CTX`
- Depends on: `P2-TOOL-01`, `P2-RT-01`
- Branch: `codex/p2-tool-03-command-run`
- Owned paths: `packages/agent-tools/`, `packages/agent-runtime/`, `tests/`

#### Goal

Implement the first builtin command tool using typed executable plus argv, not free-form shell strings.

#### Deliverables

- command tool contract
- runtime invocation mapping
- timeout propagation
- tests for success, non-zero exit, and timeout

#### Acceptance

- [x] Command execution does not rely on unrestricted shell parsing.
- [x] Exit code and captured output are returned in structured form.
- [x] Timeout handling is tested end to end.

## Notes

- Historical Phase 0 task plans from older docs are no longer the active task registry.
- New tasks should be added using `TASK_CARD_TEMPLATE.md` and must align with the active execution set.
