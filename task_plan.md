# Task Plan

## SUBAGENT-UX-01 - Model-Native Subagent Delegation

1. `completed` - Approve and independently review the model-native delegation
   design, then register a separate owned task and branch.
2. `completed` - Inject manifest-aware parent guidance and require a model-authored
   delegation reason with actionable validation recovery.
3. `completed` - Prove direct, parent-tool, complex delegation, invalid-call retry,
   child non-recursion, and failed-child fallback behavior.
4. `completed` - Update durable architecture/status records and run focused, full,
   static, Eval, and real-model simple-task validation.

## CTX-SEG-01 - Stable Task And Automatic Internal Segments

1. `completed` - Record ADR-013, supersede the explicit user handoff decision,
   and define the dependency-ordered Task/Segment implementation roadmap.
2. `completed` - Remove ordinary Desktop handoff rendering, navigation, and client
   creation actions without changing backend safety contracts.
3. `completed` - Add a deterministic regression that forbids stage handoff controls
   on the ordinary user surface.
4. `completed` - Run Desktop checks/build and repository validation, then update
   durable status, findings, and worklog evidence.
5. `completed` - Add Task/Segment domain and SQLite projection/migration contracts.
6. `completed` - Add Task API, monotonic cross-Segment stream, and active-Segment routing.
7. `completed` - Add deterministic lifecycle controller and automatic safe rollover.
8. `completed` - Bind Desktop to stable Task identity and add cross-Segment regressions.
9. `completed` - Run all gates, update closeout evidence, push, and open the PR.

### Errors Encountered

- The first full test run found `session_handoffs.py` at 526 lines after the
  atomic Task CAS integration. Task-specific storage logic and row types were
  moved to their owned modules; the file is now 497 lines and the gate passes.
