# Task Plan

## ARCH-RUNTIME-V2-PLAN-01 - Runtime V2 Proposal Current-State Alignment

1. `completed` - Compare every proposal lane with current docs, code and task evidence.
2. `completed` - Rewrite the proposal as a current-state delta with explicit authority
   and non-executable status.
3. `completed` - Align the docs guide, PROGRESS and task governance without modifying the
   final architecture or activating implementation.
4. `completed` - Run fresh-reader ambiguity/contradiction tests and documentation gates.
5. `completed` - Record durable evidence and commit the docs-only branch locally.

### Decisions

- Use `origin/main@a6b47c3f` as the review baseline; keep the dirty local main
  worktree and its untracked documents untouched.
- Classify the proposal in `docs/README.md`, not the product README, so an
  exploratory document is not mistaken for the operator or architecture entry.
- A future reusable Agent is named `AgentDefinition`; existing `AgentTask` remains
  the durable user execution identity.
- This proposal may recommend ADRs and locked follow-up cards, but cannot modify
  the final architecture or claim implementation completion.

## CTX-SEG-02 - Follow-up Context And Budget Recovery

1. `completed` - Register and claim the path-bounded repair task on an isolated branch.
2. `completed` - Preserve a bounded prior user/assistant checkpoint across terminal follow-up rollover.
3. `completed` - Remove implicit low call ceilings and suspend recoverably when an explicit hard budget cannot fit a complete batch.
4. `completed` - Hide NoopVerifier status noise while keeping real verifier evidence visible.
5. `completed` - Update durable architecture/status records and run focused, full, Desktop, and quality gates.

## WEB-UX-01 - Trusted Local Read-Only Web Auto Execution

1. `completed` - Register and claim a path-bounded task on an independent branch.
2. `completed` - Treat durable allowlist Web authority as automatic allow and
   explicit local trusted mode as a one-time operator trust boundary.
3. `completed` - Default new Desktop tasks to trusted local Web authority and
   preserve durable profile rendering.
4. `completed` - Run focused, full repository, Desktop, and browser regressions;
   then close the task with durable evidence.
5. `completed` - Upgrade existing local Tasks at execution time, honor the
   system HTTPS proxy, remove local command/MCP approval interruptions, and rerun
   the real old-Task plus full regression chain.

## SUBAGENT-UX-01 - Model-Native Subagent Delegation

1. `completed` - Approve and independently review the model-native delegation
   design, then register a separate owned task and branch.
2. `completed` - Inject manifest-aware parent guidance and require a model-authored
   delegation reason with actionable validation recovery.
3. `completed` - Prove direct, parent-tool, complex delegation, invalid-call retry,
   child non-recursion, and failed-child fallback behavior.
4. `completed` - Update durable architecture/status records and run focused, full,
   static, Eval, and real-model simple-task validation.

## CTX-SEG-01 - Stable Task And Automatic Internal Segments

1. `completed` - Record ADR-013, supersede the explicit user handoff decision,
   and define the dependency-ordered Task/Segment implementation roadmap.
2. `completed` - Remove ordinary Desktop handoff rendering, navigation, and client
   creation actions without changing backend safety contracts.
3. `completed` - Add a deterministic regression that forbids stage handoff controls
   on the ordinary user surface.
4. `completed` - Run Desktop checks/build and repository validation, then update
   durable status, findings, and worklog evidence.
5. `completed` - Add Task/Segment domain and SQLite projection/migration contracts.
6. `completed` - Add Task API, monotonic cross-Segment stream, and active-Segment routing.
7. `completed` - Add deterministic lifecycle controller and automatic safe rollover.
8. `completed` - Bind Desktop to stable Task identity and add cross-Segment regressions.
9. `completed` - Run all gates, update closeout evidence, push, and open the PR.

### Errors Encountered

- The first full test run found `session_handoffs.py` at 526 lines after the
  atomic Task CAS integration. Task-specific storage logic and row types were
  moved to their owned modules; the file is now 497 lines and the gate passes.
